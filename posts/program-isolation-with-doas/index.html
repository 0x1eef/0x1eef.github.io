      <H2>About</H2>
      <P>This post shows how to achieve <STRONG>light program
      isolation</STRONG> by running programs with a dedicated, unprivileged
      user account via the <A href="https://man.openbsd.org/doas">doas(1)</A>
      utility. This is a simple, effective way to isolate a program from your
      "main" user account.</P>
      <P>doas(1) from the <A href="https://openbsd.org">OpenBSD project</A>
      enables one user to execute a command as another user. Although ports
      exist for other platforms, they do not offer the same features or
      security guarantees and generally I do not recommend using them. On
      FreeBSD, <A href="https://man.freebsd.org/mdo">mdo(1)</A> is the
      recommended alternative. See <A href=
      "https://0x1eef.github.io/posts/an-mdo-introduction/">an introduction to
      mdo(1)</A> for more details.</P>
      <H2>Motivation</H2>
      <P>Sometimes it can be helpful to isolate a program from your "main" user
      account in case the program is compromised, at least then the damage can
      be minimized. An attacker would have to first break out of the dedicated
      user account, and achieve root or otherwise access your "main" user
      account.</P>
      <P>It also becomes possible to apply certain controls and limits to a
      particular user account by assigning the user a login class â€“ these might
      be limits you may not want your "main" user account to have.</P>
      <P>It is important to note though that as far as isolation goes, this
      approach is thin. There are alternatives such as VMs, jails and
      containers that provide better isolation but at the same time, this
      approach also has its time and place.</P>
      <H2>User</H2>
      <P><STRONG>Context</STRONG></P>
      <P>The first step is to create a new, unprivileged user account for the
      program you want to isolate. We'll use the IRC client weechat as our
      example because it is simple and straight forward. Let's create the
      user:</P>
      <PRE><CODE class="language-sh">root@localhost# useradd \
  -d /home/weechat \
  -s /sbin/nologin \
  -m \
  -v \
  weechat

root@localhost# chmod u=rwx,go= /home/weechat
</CODE></PRE><BR>
      <P><STRONG>Explanation</STRONG></P>
      <UL>
        <LI>
          <P>-d /home/weechat<BR>
          This flag sets <CODE>/home/weechat</CODE> as the home directory. This
          is where all of weechat's data (configuration, scripts, logs, etc) is
          kept.</P>
        </LI>
        <LI>
          <P>-s /sbin/nologin<BR>
          This flag sets the user's login shell to <CODE>nologin</CODE> and
          effectively prevents logging into the account unless it is done and
          permitted by doas(1).</P>
        </LI>
        <LI>
          <P>-m<BR>
          This flag automatically creates the user's home directory.</P>
        </LI>
        <LI>
          <P>-v<BR>
          This flag enables verbose mode.</P>
        </LI>
        <LI>
          <P>chmod u=rwx,go= /home/weechat<BR>
          This command gives the <CODE>weechat</CODE> user full read, write,
          and execute permissions over its home directory and prevents access
          for anyone else.</P>
        </LI>
      </UL>
      <H2>Configuration</H2>
      <P><STRONG>Context</STRONG></P>
      <P>In the next step we will configure doas(1) to allow our "main" user
      account execute the weechat program as the <CODE>weechat</CODE> user.
      This can be done through a configuration file that defines one or more
      rules, and each rule defines what user(s) can execute a command as
      another user. Let's get started by editing <CODE>/etc/doas.conf</CODE>
      and adding the following contents:</P>
      <PRE><CODE class="language-sh"># /etc/doas.conf
permit nopass main as weechat cmd /usr/local/bin/weechat args
</CODE></PRE><BR>
      <P><STRONG>Explanation</STRONG></P>
      <UL>
        <LI>
          <P>permit nopass main as weechat<BR>
          This part of the rule allows your <CODE>main</CODE> user to execute
          commands as the <CODE>weechat</CODE> user without a password. It is
          convenient for quick access but asking for a password would add
          another layer of security (this can be done by omitting
          <CODE>nopass</CODE>).</P>
        </LI>
        <LI>
          <P>cmd /usr/local/bin/weechat<BR>
          This part of the rule specifies the full path to the weechat
          executable. The full path is used to prevent running an unintended
          executable that might be on your $PATH.</P>
        </LI>
        <LI>
          <P>args<BR>
          By including <CODE>args</CODE> on its own <CODE>doas</CODE> will
          refuse to execute <CODE>/usr/local/bin/weechat</CODE> unless it is
          given exactly <EM>zero</EM> arguments. This could be further relaxed
          to allow only certain arguments, or omitted entirely to allow
          <EM>all</EM> arguments.</P>
        </LI>
      </UL>
      <H2>Conclusion</H2>
      <P><STRONG>Context</STRONG></P>
      <P>Before we execute doas(1) it can help to have a general idea of how it
      works. As a setuid binary owned by root, doas(1) will be run with an
      effective user id of 0 (root). When successful doas(1) will execute a
      system call that drops privileges to the weechat user, and in turn
      changes the real|effective user ID along with the real|effective group ID
      associated with a process. Finally, execvpe is called and a new process
      is started as the weechat user. That explanation is a slight
      over-simplication but it does accruately describe how tools like doas(1)
      generally work.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Demo</STRONG></P>
      <P>With the dedicated user created and <CODE>doas.conf</CODE> configured,
      we can now log in with the <CODE>main</CODE> user account and launch
      weechat as the <CODE>weechat</CODE> user.</P>
      <PRE><CODE class="language-sh"># Launch weechat as the 'weechat' user
main@localhost$ doas -u weechat /usr/local/bin/weechat
</CODE></PRE>
