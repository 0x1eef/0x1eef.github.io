      <P>In our Quran study sessions, we believe that everyone should be able
      to study the Quran and understand it through their own effort and
      reflection. The Quran must remain an accessible text. If its contents
      were encrypted and the key to unlocking it belonged only to a specific
      person or group, it would open the door to corruption. Anyone with the
      ability to think should be able to study and understand it.</P>
      <H2>Organized Religion</H2>
      <H3>Lessons from Christianity</H3>
      <P>Personally, I argue that if the Quran is meant as the message and word
      of God for everyone, yet the key to understanding it resides only with
      certain people, then the door is open to corruption–just as it was for
      the Christian Bible. The Catholic Church claimed that only through them
      could one understand the Bible, and only through the Church could people
      be guided and receive God’s message.</P>
      <P>This corruption eventually grew to the point where some corrupt
      priests were literally selling parts of paradise for money. At the same
      time, the Church neither allowed freedom of thought nor welcomed
      radically new ideas. For example, even though the Bible had no opinion on
      the shape of the Earth, the Church declared the Earth was flat and that
      the Sun and Moon orbited around it. When some scientists proposed the
      Earth’s roundness, they were persecuted, and some were even executed.</P>
      <P>Your faith had to be approved by the Church, which determined who was
      a believer and who was an unbeliever.</P>
      <H2>Independent Religion</H2>
      <H3>The Islamic Perspective</H3>
      <P>In contrast, Islam has never had a single central authority for laws
      or beliefs. As a result, some believe that “orthodox” and “heterodox” in
      Islam are meaningless, or that there is no such thing as “Orthodox
      Islam”. Others view Sunni Islam as orthodox. Even so, freedom of thought
      has not truly existed widespread among Muslims. In almost every century,
      there have been Muslims whose ideas diverged from the mainstream, and
      these people were often not treated well. In some cases, Muslims with
      “abnormal” thoughts were even executed.</P>
      <P>In one of our Quranic study sessions, a participant objected, “Do you
      think that all the findings and opinions of scholars over the past 1,400
      years are wrong, and your opinion is correct?” There was another
      participant whose views differed from the majority of Muslims. He
      replied, “These opinions were not written over the past 1,400 years–they
      were written only in 70 years.”</P>
      <P>I didn’t understand this at first. But when I researched the four
      schools of thought in Sunni Islam, I realized something important. Sunni
      Islam can be considered synonymous with orthodox Islam: most Muslims are
      Sunni and follow one of these four schools. The founders of the four
      schools were Imam Abu Hanifa, Malik, Shafi’i, and Hanbal. The interesting
      thing is that these four religious leaders lived relatively close to each
      other in time:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Abu Hanifa: 80–150 AH</LI>
        <LI>Malik: 93–179 AH</LI>
        <LI>Shafi’i: 150–204 AH</LI>
        <LI>Hanbal: 164–241 AH</LI>
      </UL>
      <P>The time between Imam Abu Hanifa’s birth and Imam Hanbal’s death is
      less than 200 years. Imam Malik was the teacher of Imam Shafi’i, who in
      turn was the teacher of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal. Later scholars mostly
      followed one of these four schools. Of course, other schools of thought
      existed, but most have become extinct; even the Hanbali school today has
      very few followers. The two other still-existing schools are the Ja'fari
      and the Zahiri schools. Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, considered the founder of
      the Ja'fari school, lived at the same time as Abu Hanifa. However,
      Ja'fari is considered a school in Shia Islam, not Sunni.</P>
      <P>As a result, the Islam practiced today is not the product of 1,400
      years of independent and free thought among scholars. Rather, it mostly
      stems from the tree planted in the early centuries of Islam. I don’t
      believe all the opinions of these schools are wrong, but I do think not
      everything we have today is fully aligned with the “Straight Path”.</P>

      <P><STRONG>Edited 5 September 2025:</STRONG> A friend took this post
      badly. He said:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>“Islam is a revelation and was given by God. No one invented it.
        There is a difference between Islam and Fiqh. Fiqh is the invention and
        product of people.”</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>This is true–I believe the same. But for daily life, for example, for
      people in my city, the Fiqh of Imam Shafi’i is the only “Islam” they
      know. If you ask whether a girl with painted nails can perform a proper
      ablution (wudhu), the answer is that her wudhu is invalid because Imam
      Shafi’i said water should reach every part of the hand–but water cannot
      reach the natural nails. Does the Quran say water must reach everywhere?
      Or does it just tell us to wash our hands?</P>
      <P>Or that you should recite Surah al-Hamd in every rak’ah of the prayer
      (salat) because Imam Shafi’i said so. Few people refer to the Quran or
      hadith to check what should be done in prayer. This becomes worse when
      sayings (in Arabic: zikr, plural: azkar) during bowing (ruku’) and
      prostration (sujud) are required because a mosque’s imam taught so–even
      though in Shafi’i fiqh, these sayings are not obligatory.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Edited 9 September 2025:</STRONG> According to some sources,
      Imams Malik and Abu Hanifa were both students of Imam Ja'far
      al-Sadiq!</P>
